			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm">It's easy to convince oneself that things can't <em>really</em> be that terrible, that the horror I allude to is being overblown, that what is going on elsewhere in space-time is somehow less real than the here-and-now, or that the good in the world somehow offsets the bad. Yet however vividly one thinks one can imagine what agony, torture or suicidal despair must be like, the reality is inconceivably worse. The force of "inconceivably" is itself largely inconceivable here.</blockquote>

In my view, such suffering is like a black hole that sucks all light out of the world. [...] Yet, by extension, this also implies that there <em>is</em> a form of light whose value <em>does</em> compare to this darkness, and that is the kind of light we should aspire to become, namely the light that brightens and prevents this darkness.</blockquote>

			<blockquote cite="Anti-Natalism and the Future of Suffering: Why Negative Utilitarians Should Not Aim For Extinction">If humanity is to minimize suffering in the future, it must engage with the world, not opt out of it.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/social-media/pre2014.html">[...] one might naively suppose that a negative utilitarian would welcome human extinction. But only (trans)humans – or our potential superintelligent successors – are technically capable of phasing out the cruelties of the rest of the living world on Earth. And only (trans)humans – or rather our potential superintelligent successors – are technically capable of assuming stewardship of our entire Hubble volume.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="The Hedonistic Imperative">Taking the abolitionist project to the rest of the galaxy and beyond sounds crazy today; but it's the application of technology to a very homely moral precept writ large, not the outgrowth of a revolutionary new ethical theory. So long as sentient beings suffer extraordinary unpleasantness - whether on Earth or perhaps elsewhere - there is a presumptive case to eradicate such suffering wherever it is found.</blockquote>

			<h1>Synopsis</h1>
			<p>In the universe where nothing prevents the worst - and where the worst itself is bounded only by the physical laws - <em>bad</em> things can and do happen. Given the unmatched urgency and badness of intense suffering, not being proactive about the suffering problem is ethically <em>unacceptable</em>.</p>
			<p>Alas, unbiased intelligence (and, by extension, universal compassion) are highly unlikely phenotypes in the Darwinian world: the world where brute force is favoured by the amoral, near-sighted gene replication and where minds capable and motivated to contemplate the nature of the game are too improbable, costly and maladaptive.</p>
			<p>The modern civilization, while mitigating many misearies of natural selection, is still largely a wasteful puppet of the human animal and blind trends. (Just the fact that humanity perpetuates factory farming serves as a powerful reminder of that.)</p>
			<p>The situation is dire since the meager compassion and intelligence that humanity can muster are evidently not enough to even recognize, let alone start to address, the problem of suffering. Suffering is endemic to sentient Darwinian life and can only be hoped to be solved by unprecedented smart cooperation...</p>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/adriano.mannino/posts/10209676146034100?comment_id=10209693771474725">When in doubt, why not make the highest priority value explicit? Our current civilisation arguably suffers less from a lack of intelligence than from a lack of compassion.</blockquote>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/superwell.html">Potentially, we can use a convergence of biotech, nanorobotics and information technology to gain control over our emotions and become better (post-)human beings, to cultivate the virtues, strength of character, decency, to become kinder, friendlier, more compassionate: to become the type of (post)human beings that we might aspire to be, but aren't, and biologically couldn't be, with the neural machinery of unenriched minds. Given our Darwinian biology, too many forms of admirable behaviour simply aren't rewarding enough for us to practise them consistently: our second-order desires to live better lives as better people are often feeble echoes of our baser passions.</blockquote>

			<p>For <a href="https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/">suffering-leaned</a> altruists today, the guardian identity can serve as a powerful mental tool to see the long-term purpose, reduce akrasia and bond with other aspiring guardians / abolitionists.</p>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/neojainism.html">In the real world, maybe we're alone. The skies look empty. Cynics might point to the mess on Earth and echo C.S. Lewis: "Let's pray that the human race never escapes from Earth to spread its iniquity elsewhere." Yet our ethical responsibility is to discover whether other suffering sentients exist within our cosmological horizon; establish the theoretical upper bounds of rational agency; and assume responsible stewardship of our Hubble volume. Cosmic responsibility entails full-spectrum superintelligence: to be blissful but not "blissed out" - high-tech Jainism on a cosmological scale. We don't yet know whether the story of life has a happy ending.</blockquote>
