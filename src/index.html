				<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm">It's easy to convince oneself that things can't <em>really</em> be that terrible, that the horror I allude to is being overblown, that what is going on elsewhere in space-time is somehow less real than the here-and-now, or that the good in the world somehow offsets the bad. Yet however vividly one thinks one can imagine what agony, torture or suicidal despair must be like, the reality is inconceivably worse. The force of "inconceivably" is itself largely inconceivable here.

				<p>We, sentience, find ourselves in the universe where inconceivably bad states of consciousness are possible, are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bounded</a> only by the physical laws and <em>do happen</em> - every moment just on this planet. Given intrinsic badness and urgency of unbearable suffering, not being proactive about the suffering problem is ethically unacceptable.</p>
				<p>Nothing so far has risen to solve the suffering problem. Worse, pain, pleasure, and other feelings have been co-opted by evolution to optimize its sole “goal” of gene replication. Sentient beings are throwaway genetic vehicles in the unfolding of amoral physical forces, which evolution logically follows from.</p>
				<p>Unbiased intelligence and (by extension) universal compassion are highly unlikely phenotypes in the Darwinian world - the world where minds capable and motivated to contemplate the nature of the “game” are too improbable, costly and maladaptive.
				<p>The modern civilization, while preventing many miseries of the wild Darwinian order, still is largely an inefficient puppet of humans’ baser wants and blind trends. (Just the fact that humanity perpetuates factory farming serves as a powerful reminder of that.)</p>
				<p>The situation is dire since the meager compassion and intelligence that humanity can muster are evidently not enough to recognize, let alone start to address, the problem of suffering. Suffering is endemic to sentient Darwinian life and can only be hoped to be solved by unprecedented smart coordination...</p>

Given our Darwinian biology, too many forms of admirable behaviour simply aren't rewarding enough for us to practise them consistently: our second-order desires to live better lives as better people are often feeble echoes of our baser passions.

				<p>At present, we are a growing network of desperate / ambitious individuals exploring and promoting the mission (of <a href=”https://www.abolitionist.com/”>abolishing</a> / reducing and preventing suffering). Our goal is to bootstrap a guardian society.</p>
				<p>Necessarily for any semblance of success, we seek solutions for the imposed limitations of the human mind and the hostile / indifferent environment. We see (certain versions of) transhumanism as the most promising approach to establishing a sustainable society of guardians.</p>
				<p>If you endorse suffering-focused ethics, feel inspired by the guardian identity (you have great leeway imagining it ;) ) and want to help us develop the idea further, consider <a href="https://forms.gle/227kTu9FoduzBUxo7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applying</a> for joining our online community.</p>

Lewis: "Let's pray that the human race never escapes from Earth to spread its iniquity elsewhere." Yet our ethical responsibility is to discover whether other suffering sentients exist within our cosmological horizon; establish the theoretical upper bounds of rational agency; and assume responsible stewardship of our Hubble volume. Cosmic responsibility entails full-spectrum superintelligence: to be blissful but not "blissed out" - high-tech Jainism on a cosmological scale.
