			<h1>We are the nascent compassionate force in the amoral universe. We exist to abolish suffering and to guard against its re-appearance.</h1>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm">It's easy to convince oneself that things can't <em>really</em> be that terrible, that the horror I allude to is being overblown, that what is going on elsewhere in space-time is somehow less real than the here-and-now, or that the good in the world somehow offsets the bad. Yet however vividly one thinks one can imagine what agony, torture or suicidal despair must be like, the reality is inconceivably worse. The force of "inconceivably" is itself largely inconceivable here.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/">[...] some pockets of the universe are in a state of insufferable darkness — a state of black suffering. In my view, such suffering is like a black hole that sucks all light out of the world. Or rather: the intrinsic value of all the light of the world pales in comparison to the disvalue of this darkness. Yet, by extension, this also implies that there <em>is</em> a form of light whose value <em>does</em> compare to this darkness, and that is the kind of light we should aspire to become, namely the light that brightens and prevents this darkness.</blockquote>

			<p>The Guardians project is an incipient long-term effort to <a href="https://www.abolitionist.com/" target="_blank">abolish</a> suffering <em>and</em> guard against its re-emergence as long as physically possible.</p>
			<p>Guardians are a (necessary) transhuman society explicitly dedicated to the mission.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>The Guardian is an embodiment of the force that prevents suffering in the Universe – and who seeks to amplify the force.</p>
			<p>For suffering-leaned altruists today, the Guardian identity can be seen as a powerful mental tool to get insipred, reduce akrasia and bond with other aspiring Guardians / persons who endorse the mission.</p>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/superwell.html">Potentially, we can use a convergence of biotech, nanorobotics and information technology to gain control over our emotions and become better (post-)human beings, to cultivate the virtues, strength of character, decency, to become kinder, friendlier, more compassionate: to become the type of (post)human beings that we might aspire to be, but aren't, and biologically couldn't be, with the neural machinery of unenriched minds. Given our Darwinian biology, too many forms of admirable behaviour simply aren't rewarding enough for us to practise them consistently: our second-order desires to live better lives as better people are often feeble echoes of our baser passions.</blockquote>
