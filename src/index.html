			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm">It's easy to convince oneself that things can't <em>really</em> be that terrible, that the horror I allude to is being overblown, that what is going on elsewhere in space-time is somehow less real than the here-and-now, or that the good in the world somehow offsets the bad. Yet however vividly one thinks one can imagine what agony, torture or suicidal despair must be like, the reality is inconceivably worse. The force of "inconceivably" is itself largely inconceivable here.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/">[...] some pockets of the universe are in a state of insufferable darkness — a state of black suffering. In my view, such suffering is like a black hole that sucks all light out of the world. [...] Yet, by extension, this also implies that there <em>is</em> a form of light whose value <em>does</em> compare to this darkness, and that is the kind of light we should aspire to become, namely the light that brightens and prevents this darkness.</blockquote>

			<p>The Guardians Project is a collective effort to bootstrap a society explicitly dedicated to <a href="https://www.abolitionist.com/" target="_blank">abolishing</a> suffering <em>and guarding against its re-emergence as long as physically possible</em>.</p>

			<blockquote cite="Anti-Natalism and the Future of Suffering: Why Negative Utilitarians Should Not Aim For Extinction">If humanity is to minimize suffering in the future, it must engage with the world, not opt out of it.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/social-media/pre2014.html">[...] one might naively suppose that a negative utilitarian would welcome human extinction. But only (trans)humans – or our potential superintelligent successors – are technically capable of phasing out the cruelties of the rest of the living world on Earth. And only (trans)humans – or rather our potential superintelligent successors – are technically capable of assuming stewardship of our entire Hubble volume.</blockquote>

			<p>Guardians are a future society existing explicitly for the mission (of abolishing and preventing suffering).</p>
			<p>For <a href="https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/">suffering-leaned</a> altruists today, the guardian identity can serve as a powerful mental tool to see the long-term purpose, reduce akrasia and bond with other aspiring guardians / abolitionists.</p>

			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/superwell.html">Potentially, we can use a convergence of biotech, nanorobotics and information technology to gain control over our emotions and become better (post-)human beings, to cultivate the virtues, strength of character, decency, to become kinder, friendlier, more compassionate: to become the type of (post)human beings that we might aspire to be, but aren't, and biologically couldn't be, with the neural machinery of unenriched minds. Given our Darwinian biology, too many forms of admirable behaviour simply aren't rewarding enough for us to practise them consistently: our second-order desires to live better lives as better people are often feeble echoes of our baser passions.</blockquote>
