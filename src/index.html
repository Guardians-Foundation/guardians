			<blockquote cite="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm">It's easy to convince oneself that things can't <em>really</em> be that terrible, that the horror I allude to is being overblown, that what is going on elsewhere in space-time is somehow less real than the here-and-now, or that the good in the world somehow offsets the bad. Yet however vividly one thinks one can imagine what agony, torture or suicidal despair must be like, the reality is inconceivably worse. The force of "inconceivably" is itself largely inconceivable here.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/">[...] some pockets of the universe are in a state of insufferable darkness â€” a state of black suffering. In my view, such suffering is like a black hole that sucks all light out of the world. Or rather: the intrinsic value of all the light of the world pales in comparison to the disvalue of this darkness. Yet, by extension, this also implies that there <em>is</em> a form of light whose value <em>does</em> compare to this darkness, and that is the kind of light we should aspire to become, namely the light that brightens and prevents this darkness.</blockquote>
